    <b>TeamsCode</b> is a student-run 501(c)(3) non-profit that works to 
    encourage high school students to study computer science. We work with teachers and sponsors
    to create awesome programming contests with free snacks, pizza, medals, and prizes!
    <br></br>
    Chris Elliott and Alan Bi founded TeamsCode in the beginning of 2017. 
    Both students participated in local programming contests and noticed a lack of 
    representation from their school. They set about to change that by organizing 
    the first ever Mercer Island High School Programming Contest on April 1st, 2017.
    Since then, TeamsCode has expanded its influence across three states and hopes to continue growing. 
    <br></br>
    In addition to organizing programming contests, TeamsCode builds online programming 
    lessons in order to prepare students for the AP Computer Science A exam. We create 
    a selection of programming problems, giving students early experience with complex 
    data structures and algorithms.
    <br></br>
    TeamsCode also encourages other students to create their own programming contests. 
    We provide students with valuable support and resources to organize events at venues 
    around the Pacific Northwest. Please visit our
    <a class="a" href="/contests/create">create page</a> to create your own event!
