# Scoring #

**Overview:** There will be a multitude of programming problems, sorted by difficulty from easiest to hardest. Teams will be ranked according to the overall points they score, with ties being broken in favor of the team with the lower time score. Each problem is worth a different number of points.* 

To get all the points for a problem, all the test cases need to be solved correctly. Partial points are awarded for programs which pass some, but not all, of the test cases.**

A team’s time score is calculated by summing the number of minutes after the start of the contest of each problem’s latest submission. Each problem can be attempted as many times as a team would like; only the best submission will be scored. However, every submission after the first one will add a certain number of minutes to your time score.***

The three highest ranked teams in each division will receive prizes.  

_\* To be precise, problem N is worth a total of 120 + 10 \* N points. Thus, a perfect score is 3000 points. For example, problem 10 is worth 120 + 10 \* 10 = 220 points._

_** If a team answers C (0 ≤ C < T) out of T test cases correctly on a problem worth P points, then the points awarded can be given by the formula: P \* ( C / ( T - 1 ) ) / 2. Thus, there is a large bonus (half the points!) for completely solving the question._

_*** Every attempt after the first one on problem N will add N minutes to your time score. For example, retrying problem 3 will add 3 minutes to your time score, and retrying problem 15 will add 15 minutes to your time score._
