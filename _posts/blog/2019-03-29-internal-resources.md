Since the first MIHS Programming Contest in the spring of 2017, countless student-led programming contests have been hosted, and not just by TeamsCode: both Issaquah and Interlake High School have successfully started their own events. We are ecstatic to see this and believe that more student-led contests contribute to a number of benefits, including the following:

1. More opportunities for students to practice their coding skills
2. More events at which to meet and socialize with like-minded students from other schools
3. The creation of a welcoming environment that's easy for new programmers to enter
4. The opportunity for student organizers to contribute to the community while simultaneously developing practical leadership and business skills

We know how challenging organizing a programming contest can be. Luckily, through trial and error, we have found many useful tools to help us, many of which are essential to keeping us afloat every day. In this blog post, I'll be sharing our resources in order to help other students organize their events as well as encourage those considering the idea to go for it.
