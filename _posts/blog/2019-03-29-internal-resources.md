Since the first MIHS Programming Contest in the spring of 2017, countless student-led programming contests have been hosted, and not just by TeamsCode: both Issaquah and Interlake High School have successfully started their own events. We are ecstatic to see this and believe that more student-led contests contribute to a number of benefits, including the following:

1. More opportunities for students to practice their coding skills
2. More events at which to meet and socialize with like-minded students from other schools
3. The creation of a welcoming environment that's easy for new programmers to enter
4. The opportunity for student organizers to contribute to the community while simultaneously developing practical leadership and business skills

We know how challenging organizing a programming contest can be. Luckily, through trial and error, we have found many useful tools to help us, many of which are essential to keeping us afloat every day. In this blog post, I'll be sharing our resources in order to help other students organize their events as well as encourage those considering the idea to go for it. 

Below, I've organized our tools into seven categories. If you're interested in a specific section, click on the header to jump straight to that part.

**Google Drive**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-drive.png" alt="Drive" width="100%">

As mentioned in a <a class="a" href="https://teamscode.com/blog/looking-forward-with-teamscode/">previous blog post</a>, we store all of our files in a shared <a class="a" href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> folder. This include things like our problem sets, input files, scoreboards, registration data, contacts, finances, and much, much more. Organizing a programming contest requires a lot of planning, so it's useful to have a centralized location for all your resources. 

**Slack**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-slack.png" alt="Slack" width="100%">

<a class="a" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is a messaging platform that we use for the majority of our internal communications. Slack allows us to create channels for specific purposes, such as to dicuss our Washington and Oregon contests separately or direct message certain members. We use Slack almost every single day because of how important it is to communicate with each other. 

**Typeform**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-typeform.png" alt="Typeform" width="100%">

<a class="a" href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a> is a form and survey builder that we use for a variety of purposes. Beyond just using Typeform for contest registration, it works well in other ways like collecting feedback or collecting applications to join TeamsCode. 

**GitHub**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-github.png" alt="GitHub" width="100%">

We host our website on <a class="a" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. GitHub allows several of us to edit and add to the website easily. At the same time, since teamscode.com is a static site, we can host it for free using GitHub Pages, meaning any changes we push to GitHub will automatically update the website. 

**Trello**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-trello.png" alt="Trello" width="100%">

<a class="a" href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> is a tool that we use to plan our tasks and pretty much anything else we want to do with it. With Trello, you have boards, and within each board, you can create individual cards which are ordered by lists. We frequently create <a class="a" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards">Kanban</a> boards in Trello, meaning that we put tasks in "Pending", "In Progress", and "Done" lists to keep track of our progress.

**Zoho Mail**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-zoho.png" alt="Zoho Mail" width="100%">

We use <a class="a" href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/">Zoho Mail</a> for our email platform. Emails like support@teamscode.com and contest@teamscode.com go to our primary inbox, while emails like mihs@teamscode.com and oregon@teamscode.com are linked to separate inboxes. We used to use teamscode1@gmail.com with Gmail but switched to Zoho in order to use email addresses with our custom domain, teamscode.com. 

**MailChimp**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-zoho.png" alt="Zoho Mail" width="100%">

We use <a class="a" href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/">Zoho Mail</a> for our email platform. Emails like support@teamscode.com and contest@teamscode.com go to our primary inbox, while emails like mihs@teamscode.com and oregon@teamscode.com are linked to separate inboxes. We used to use teamscode1@gmail.com with Gmail but switched to Zoho in order to use email addresses with our custom domain, teamscode.com. 

**appear.in**

<img src="/assets/blog_images/resources-appear.png" alt="appear.in" width="100%">

<a class="a" href="https://appear.in/">appear.in</a>

**Facebook**
