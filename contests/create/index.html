        We empower students by helping them create their own programming contests! 
        We give high schoolers the resources and knowledge needed to join our team 
        and create official TeamsCode events. We can work with your schedule to help you 
        make an awesome programming contest, bootcamp, or hackathon! Creating a contest
        will require several months and a large amount of work, so start early and be
        prepared to spend a lot of time. In addition, we require a solid commitment to
        hosting a contest. In order to guide you through the process, we must ensure that
        you are willing to work and support the organization.
